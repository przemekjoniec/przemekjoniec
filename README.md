<h2>About Me:</h2>

👨🏼‍🎓 I am a student at a technical school, specializing in IT. 👨🏼‍💻I am fascinated by the world of web development, and I dedicate a lot of time to learning programming and creating websites. Besides that, I have many other passions. 🪴I love plants and spend my free time taking care of them. 🌲I also value being close to nature, so any opportunity to be outdoors is priceless to me. 📖I am interested in history and enjoy watching movies that can captivate me for hours.
